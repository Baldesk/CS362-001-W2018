Bugs Found:

1)
Description:
In the Appt class the isValid() method is missing an if statement that checks the hour value in an appointment.

Line Numbers in Source Code:
Appt.java line 114

Details:
The isValid method is should check to make sure that an appointment contains values that are valid.
In this case there should be an if statement that checks to see if the startHour is between 0 and 23 inclusive.

Testing that revealed the bug:
Several tests in the ApptTest class failed including test 2,4,8, and 10. Failures were a result of assertions
that did not pass. All of the assertions tested the isValid() method and checked to see if the correct
value was returned when given bad values for startHour. These consecutive errors made it quite clear that
the startHour value was not being checked correctly.



2)
Description:
In the CalDay class the addAppt() method is performing incorrectly.

Line Numbers in Source Code:
CalDay.java line 75

Details:
The addAppt() method is not preforming correctly. The bug results from the for loop on line 75 not being
initialized with the correct value i = 0. Instead i is initialized as 1.

Testing that revealed the bug:
Initial unit tests showed that CalDay.test12() was failing because of an assertion error.
This assertion is used to verify that appointments are added correctly to the CalDay. This is done
in the addAppt method of CalDay. Further examination of the surefire reports showed that the method
was failing to add appointments at certain times. It was clear that the loop in the method was functioning
incorrectly. I then noticed that the loop was initialized with i = 1 which would causes the
loop to not execute when the size of the appointment list is 1. It is clear that
initializing i to 0 would solve this bug.
